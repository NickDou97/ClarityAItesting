# Code Quality Assurance Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the code quality improvements made to ensure consistent styling and reduce unused code across the website codebase.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### CSS Issues

1. **Excessive use of `!important` flags in `header-fix.css`**
   - Removed unnecessary `!important` declarations where standard CSS specificity would suffice
   - Improved maintainability and reduced CSS specificity conflicts

2. **Duplicate CSS variable declaration in `assessment.css`**
   - Removed duplicate `--glass-panel` variable definition that had conflicting values
   - Retained the correct value (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)`) for consistent styling

3. **Style redundancy between files**
   - Identified overlapping styles between `styles.css` and `assessment.css`
   - CSS variables are properly modularized but maintained consistency across files

### JavaScript Issues

1. **Commented out unused import in `assessment.js`**
   - Removed commented import statement for VisualizationManager that was no longer used
   - Cleaned up code for better readability

2. **Duplicate scroll event handler in `main.js`**
   - Removed redundant header scroll effect code that was already implemented in `initNavigation()`
   - Prevents potential race conditions and unnecessary event handling

3. **Inefficient visualization implementation in `assessment.js`**
   - Refactored `AssessmentVisualizationManager` to use global CLARITY_COLORS
   - Simplified chart creation and improved performance
   - Reduced duplicate color definitions for better maintenance

## Overall Improvements

1. **Reduced CSS Specificity Issues**
   - Removed unnecessary `!important` declarations
   - Improved cascade and specificity management

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Removed redundant code that performed the same tasks
   - Consolidated related functionality

3. **Improved Resource Usage**
   - Simplified initialization processes
   - Removed duplicate event handlers

4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Used consistent variable naming across files
   - Improved error handling
   - Better organized CSS variables

## Next Steps

1. Consider further consolidation of CSS files to reduce duplication
2. Implement a CSS preprocessor for better variable management
3. Add additional documentation for developer onboarding
4. Consider implementing a component-based approach for better reusability
