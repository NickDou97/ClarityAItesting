# ClarityAI UX Design Specifications

## Purpose
This document provides design specifications and user experience guidelines for ClarityAI's assessment tool, focused on helping customer experience (CX) teams understand and visualize their maturity levels. These guidelines ensure the tool effectively communicates complex data through appropriate visualizations while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

## User Personas

### Primary: CX Team Leaders
- **Goals**: Quickly assess team capabilities, identify gaps, plan resource allocation
- **Pain Points**: Limited visibility into strengths/weaknesses, difficulty explaining technical concepts to stakeholders
- **Technical Proficiency**: Moderate to high
- **Device Preference**: Desktop (70%), Tablet (20%), Mobile (10%)

### Secondary: CX Practitioners
- **Goals**: Self-assessment, skill development planning
- **Pain Points**: Unclear advancement paths, difficulty prioritizing learning objectives
- **Technical Proficiency**: Varies widely
- **Device Preference**: Desktop (50%), Mobile (50%)

## Key UX Requirements

### Visualization Design
1. **Provide multiple visualization options** to accommodate different cognitive preferences:
   - Radar/Spider chart (default for desktop): Effective for holistic view
   - Bar chart (default for mobile): Better for direct comparisons
   - Include toggle mechanism between visualization types

2. **Implement clear visual hierarchy**:
   - Use consistent color coding for dimensions (Strategy, Process, Technology, etc.)
   - Ensure sufficient contrast between user scores and benchmarks
   - Apply visual emphasis to areas requiring immediate attention

3. **Ensure mobile-first responsive design**:
   - For screens < 768px: Default to bar chart visualization
   - For screens > 768px: Default to radar visualization
   - Adapt input controls for touch interfaces on mobile devices

### Assessment Flow Design

1. **Create guided assessment experience**:
   ```
   Step 1: Introduction → Step 2: Assessment form → Step 3: Results → Step 4: Action plan
   ```

2. **Implement progressive disclosure**:
   - Break assessment into logical sections
   - Show one dimension group at a time
   - Include progress indicator

3. **Provide contextual help**:
   - Add tooltips for technical terms
   - Include dimension-specific explanations
   - Offer "Learn more" links for deeper understanding

## Interaction Guidelines

### Form Controls

```css
/* Implement these slider styles for consistent interaction */
.assessment-slider {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  height: 8px;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #e0e0e0, #6E59F2);
  border-radius: 4px;
  outline: none;
}

.assessment-slider::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  width: 24px;
  height: 24px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #6E59F2;
  cursor: pointer;
  border: 2px solid white;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.assessment-slider::-webkit-slider-thumb:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}

/* Ensure accessible focus states */
.assessment-slider:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(110, 89, 242, 0.3);
}
```

### Visualization Interactions

1. **Implement hover/tap states** for visualization elements:
   - On hover/tap of dimension point: Show exact score and benchmark
   - On hover/tap of dimension label: Highlight corresponding area in chart

2. **Add animation for cognitive reinforcement**:
   - Animate chart drawing on initial reveal (duration: 800ms)
   - Subtle pulse animation for areas needing attention
   - Smooth transitions between chart types (300ms)

3. **Design interactive guided tour**:
   ```javascript
   // Example tour stop configuration
   const tourSteps = [
     {
       target: '.visualization-container',
       content: 'This visualization shows your team\'s maturity across 6 key dimensions',
       placement: 'bottom'
     },
     {
       target: '.benchmark-legend',
       content: 'The dotted line represents industry benchmarks for your comparison',
       placement: 'top'
     },
     {
       target: '.viz-toggle-btn',
       content: 'Switch between chart types to view your data differently',
       placement: 'left'
     }
   ];
   ```

## Cognitive Design Principles

1. **Reduce cognitive load**:
   - Limit visible options at any one time
   - Group related information visually
   - Use progressive disclosure for complex concepts

2. **Provide appropriate feedback**:
   - Confirm user actions visually and with micro-animations
   - Indicate system status clearly (loading states, success/error messages)
   - Use appropriate validation for form inputs

3. **Maintain consistency**:
   - Apply consistent color scheme throughout
   - Use standardized input controls
   - Maintain visual language across all sections

## Mobile Optimization Instructions

1. **Implement touch-target optimization**:
   - Ensure all interactive elements are at least 44×44px
   - Provide adequate spacing between touch targets (min 8px)
   - Place primary actions within thumb-reach zones

2. **Optimize for limited screen space**:
   - Use collapsible sections for detailed information
   - Prioritize visualization space on small screens
   - Consider vertical stacking for comparison data

3. **Address mobile performance concerns**:
   - Use efficient rendering techniques for visualizations
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical content
   - Test animations for smoothness on mid-tier devices

## Accessibility Requirements

1. **Support screen readers**:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to visualization elements
   - Provide text alternatives for all charts
   - Ensure keyboard navigability

2. **Implement color considerations**:
   - Maintain WCAG AA compliance for contrast (min ratio 4.5:1)
   - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
   - Test visualizations with color blindness simulators

3. **Design for cognitive accessibility**:
   - Provide clear instructions
   - Allow ample time to complete assessment
   - Support saving progress

## Implementation Validation

Before release, verify these core UX metrics:

1. **Usability testing results**:
   - Task completion rate: Target >85%
   - Time on task: <5 minutes for complete assessment
   - User satisfaction: >4/5 on post-task survey

2. **Accessibility compliance**:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility verified
   - Keyboard navigation fully functional

3. **Performance benchmarks**:
   - First meaningful paint: <2s
   - Time to interactive: <3s
   - Input response time: <100ms
