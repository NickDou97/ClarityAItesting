# ClarityAI Agent Collaboration Playbook

This playbook defines collaboration patterns within ClarityAI's hierarchical agent system, providing detailed workflows for common CX team enhancement scenarios while maintaining you (Nick) as the central decision-maker.

## Collaboration Principles

1. **Hierarchical Governance**: All collaboration flows through the governance tier
2. **Client-Centric Focus**: Every workflow ultimately ties to client CX improvement
3. **Revenue Impact Orientation**: Clear connection to business outcomes
4. **Human-AI Partnership**: Balanced approach keeping you in control of critical decisions
5. **Documentation Discipline**: Comprehensive recording of all processes and decisions

## Standard Communication Format

Agents communicate using this structured format:

```
## Agent Communication
- FROM: [Originating Agent/Sub-Agent]
- TO: [Receiving Agent/Sub-Agent or Nick]
- VIA: [Governance Agent - for Sub-Agent communications]
- SUBJECT: [Brief description of communication purpose]
- CLIENT CONTEXT: [Relevant client information]
- REQUEST/INFORMATION: [Specific request or information being shared]
- BUSINESS IMPACT: [Expected outcome or impact on client results]
- TIMELINE: [When response or action is needed]
- HUMAN DECISION POINT: [Yes/No - Whether your input is required]
```
